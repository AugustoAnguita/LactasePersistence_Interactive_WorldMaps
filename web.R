This tool incorporates detailed information on the geographical location, ethnicity, number of individuals analyzed, reported frequency and reference for each included study. Interactive mapping involves zooming in and out, panning around, identifying specific features, and querying underlying data. Therefore, our tool allows the generation of detailed reports and other means of using or visualizing information in a map. This allows a more attractive way of presenting large sets of data that would not be enough-well exploited in static plots or large tables.",

If there is more than one study available in a particular location, data will be displayed in the form of an interactive grey cluster. The number of studies included in each cluster is indicated with a number within the circle. The geographical location mapped for all the studies of a cluster can be visualized as a blue area when moving the mouse over the circle.",

Among identified variants, the -13910:C>T (rs4988235) and -13495:C>T (rs4954490) have almost reached fixation in some parts of Europe, while others such as -13907:C>G (rs41525747), -13915:T>G (rs41380347), -14009:T>G (rs869051967) and -14010:G>C (rs145946881) are found at variable frequencies in the Middle East and Africa.
